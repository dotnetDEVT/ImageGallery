Instructions to run the docker Image on localhost

Make sure docker for linux container is up and running and port 80 is available to map

In Powershell please make sure you are in ImageGallery\ImageGallery path because thats where the Dockerfile is located. Once you are in the directory then please run the following command

docker build -t dotnetweb:1 .

Then go to 
wwwroot/images and run the following command

docker run -it -d -v ${PWD}:/app/wwwroot/Images/ -p 80:80 --name webdotnet dotnetweb:1

go to localhost and the app will be up and running
